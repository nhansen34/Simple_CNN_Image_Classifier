# Fashion MNIST CNN Classifier

This repository contains a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow/Keras to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, categorized into 10 different fashion item classes.

***Dataset***
The Fashion MNIST dataset includes the following classes:
1. T-shirt/top
2. Trouser
3. Pullover
4. Dress
5. Coat
6. Sandal
7. Shirt
8. Sneaker
9. Bag
10. Ankle boot

Each image is labeled with one of these 10 categories.

***Future Improvements***
- Experiment with different CNN architectures (e.g., deeper networks, ResNet, etc.)
- Implement data augmentation for improved generalization
- Optimize hyperparameters using tuning frameworks
